          Izuku is a very timid, helpful, and polite boy,
          frequently overreacting to abnormal situations with exaggerated expressions. Due to being bullied since childhood for
          being born without a Quirk, he is initially portrayed as insecure, and being more reserved and non-expressive. These actions
          are especially present around Katsuki Bakugo, who constantly subdued him for his aspirations to be a hero. However, after being accepted
          into U.A. High School, making new friends, and facing Katsuki during the Battle Trial Arc, he has gradually turned into a more confident and
          brave person, to the point of developing some leadership skills.

          Katsuki is a young man of average height, with ash blond, spiky hair and sharp red eyes. At school, he wears the standard U.A. uniform
          save for the customary red tie. Underneath his blazer, he wears a white button-up shirt with the
          first couple buttons undone. Despite wearing a belt along with the uniform's green pants, Katsuki does
          not pull them up all the way, giving his pants a baggy appearance.

          Ochaco is a young girl of short height and petite build, with fair skin that is prone to blushing,
          big round brown eyes, and shoulder-length brown hair which sports two long locks beside her face and a short bob at the back.
          Ochaco also has micro-bangs which sweep to her left.
          She has little pads on the prints of each of her fingers similar to the pads on an animal's paws, which are used to activate her Quirk.
